                <h1>Here is the short history of boats</h1>
                <br>
                <p>After Homo erectus possibly used watercraft more than a million years ago to cross straits between landmasses,[2][3] boats have served as transportation far into pre-historic times.[4] Circumstantial evidence, such as the early settlement of Australia over 40,000 years ago, findings in Crete dated 130,000 years ago[5] and in Flores dated to 900,000 years ago,[6] suggest that boats have been used since pre-historic times.[non sequitur] The earliest boats are thought to have been dugouts,[7][dubious â€“ discuss] and the oldest boats found by archaeological excavation date from around 7,000 to 10,000 years ago. The oldest recovered boat in the world, the Pesse canoe, found in the Netherlands, is a dugout made from the hollowed tree trunk of a Pinus sylvestris that was constructed somewhere between 8200 and 7600 BC. This canoe is exhibited in the Drents Museum in Assen, Netherlands</p>
